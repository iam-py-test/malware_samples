# malware_samples
Malware samples I have collected - DO NOT RUN THESE FILES<br>
These files _will_ harm your device!<br>
This repo _only_ exists to allow sharing of malware I have found and for me to peserve these files for analysis<br>

**I have not created _any_ of the malware in this repo, and am not responsible for damage caused by these programs**<br>

Note: There are a few files in this repo which are not malware, but which are used by me to manage the samples here. <br>
These are Python/Batch/Shell Script files, and - unlike the malware - retain their file extension
